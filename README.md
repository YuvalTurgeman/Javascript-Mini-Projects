# Javascript-Mini-Projects

All of these projects were formatted using "Prettier" whice is an opinionated code formatter, in order for them to be consistent and readable.

*DISCLAIMER*
These mini projects were inspired by the course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
They are my versions of rewriting the projects on my own with additions and changes.
